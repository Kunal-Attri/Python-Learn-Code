# Installing matplotlib

# To install matplotlib, first open cmd or terminal, but before
# that confirm that you don't have matplotlib already

import matplotlib

# this should give error


# So, first open cmd or terminal and pip install it
# And it has been installed. No errors.
# In next few videos , we will be playing a lot with matplotlib,
# by plotting various types of graphs, objects, animations, etc



# Thank You !!!
