# Raw Strings in Python

# Raw strings are just normal strings but they consider character
# with a backslash a normal literal character, and not a secondary
# character. eg.

# Normal string
ns = "Hi, how are you? \n I am good"
print(ns)

# Raw string
rs = r"Hi, how are you? \n I am good"
print(rs)


# Thank You !!!
